# higherLower

Hi there! not much to read here.  
This is a little game of Higher or Lower. 

## How it works
It runs in the terminal, and guides you through the game with simple text options. It also takes a given input, so you can choose the "difficulty" of the game.

## Edgecases, bugs, runtime..
I have not tested edge-cases. Who am I to tell this silly little game that I whipped up on a whim to NOT have bugs? Who am I to test the runtime of a game whose sole purpose is fun?  

No no.

If you want those answers, test it yourself.
